STANDARDS FOR BUILDING GOVT WEBSITES WITH REGIONAL SUPPORT
In Support of the Digital India Vision

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In India, NIC (National Informatics Centre) is responsible of all the government communication & information system and it works in a very distributive fashion. Each state, district, block even projects have their own set of technical people who are responsible for designing, developing and communicating all digital information through websites, which results into many issues. Some are listed below ...

- Thousands of government websites floating around with no common design language, UI/UX or coding principle.
- Almost impossible to find information/news on these websites as their are no proper indexing or listings/sitemaps.
- Wastage of resources in building the same framework again and again.
- Almost impossible to support more than 2-3 regional languages.
- Maintenance is hassle in itself.
- Finding out these websites for general public is hard and time consuming because of lack of pattern in sub domain naming etc.
- Data.gov.in takes care of opening up public data. This process includes collecting data from different websites and portals built by different government departments. Lots of it is manual task as their is no in-built api support for these portals and informative websites.
PROPOSED SOLUTION
Having a common framework to build government websites which is easy to use even for a non technical person. Possible features of the framework could be...

- Out of box crowdsourcing support for regional languages.
- Creating and managing new web pages for different projects or region websites (state websites or govt. department websites).
- Auto populated web vocabulary/sitemaps for entire information system across country which would act as entry point to find any information about govt.
- Uniform design language (Like Material Design is the default design language for Android apps) for smooth UX.
- Inbuilt API management system which follows NDSAP (http://dst.gov.in/ndsap.pdf) guidelines.
